# Internals: how Claude Code / Claude Desktop store threads

This is background for anyone extending or auditing `claude-code-threads`, not a user guide. It
describes the on-disk layout the tool depends on and refuses to guess about.

## Where things live

*(observed July 2026, Claude Desktop (Windows); format may change)*

**Transcript** — the actual conversation:

```
C:\Users\<you>\.claude\projects\<encoded-cwd>\<cliSessionId>.jsonl
```

Some threads also have a folder of the same name beside the `.jsonl`, holding subagent
transcripts. It travels with the file.

**Listing metadata** — one JSON per thread, holding its title, `cwd`, timestamps, model, and
the `cliSessionId` pointing at the transcript above:

```
C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude-code-sessions\<org-id>\<account-id>\local_<appSessionId>.json
```

Also in that folder, and **not** thread metadata: `scheduled-tasks.json`, `deleted_<id>`
markers for removed threads, and transient `*.json.tmp` files. Any bulk operation should glob
`local_*.json` specifically.

**That `%APPDATA%` path does not exist for most processes.** Claude Desktop on Windows is an
MSIX package (`Claude_<id>`, installed under `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\`), so its writes to
`%APPDATA%\Claude` are redirected into the package's private storage. The real location, and
the one to use from scripts, is:

```
C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Packages\Claude_<id>\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude-code-sessions\...
```

Only processes carrying the package identity — the app, and shells it spawns — see the merged
view where `%APPDATA%\Claude` appears to exist. From an ordinary terminal it is absent. Both
paths are the same bytes; resolving the real path on the virtual one lands on the `LocalCache`
location. Resolve the `LocalCache` path first, fall back to `%APPDATA%`, and treat a missing
store as a hard error rather than an empty result — a glob over a non-existent directory
returns zero rows, which is indistinguishable from "this thread has no listing row" unless the
absence is checked for explicitly.

Note that `~/.claude/projects` is **not** redirected — it is an ordinary profile directory that
both contexts see identically. Only the `%APPDATA%` half of the two-layer model below is
affected.

## The two-layer model

*(observed July 2026, Claude Desktop (Windows); format may change)*

This is the part that is easy to get wrong, because the two layers behave differently.

| Layer | Shared or copied? | Consequence |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Transcript (`.jsonl`) | **One genuinely shared file.** Carries no account identifier at all. | Any account whose listing points at it reads and writes the same bytes. Continuing a thread from one login and opening it from another login shows the new content immediately. |
| Listing (`local_*.json`) | **Per-account copy.** | Which threads appear, plus title/timestamp/sort order, is private to each login and frozen at copy time. |

So relocating or copying a thread's listing entry is a **snapshot**, not a live sync of the
conversation — a resumed thread's row goes stale elsewhere until re-copied. The conversation
content itself was never copied; only the pointer to it was.

## The encoding rule

*(observed July 2026, Claude Desktop (Windows); format may change)*

`<encoded-cwd>` is the project's working directory with **every character outside
`[A-Za-z0-9]` replaced by `-`** — including `:`, `\`, spaces, dots, and (as of the change below)
underscores. So `C:\Users\<you>\Projects\_Tools\my-project` becomes
`C--Users-you-Projects--Tools-my-project` — note the doubled `-` where `\_` was.

> **The rule changed around 2026-07-12.** Underscores used to survive encoding and now do not,
> which is why some projects have a folder in each form: an older-scheme folder from before the
> change, alongside a current-scheme folder from after it. Old folders are not migrated — their
> transcripts and per-project memory simply stop being read once the app moves to the new
> scheme.
>
> **Do not hard-code this rule.** Derive it from folders the app itself created: take recent
> `cwd` values out of the listing store, encode each under both schemes, and keep whichever
> matches real directories on disk. Getting it wrong files a transcript where the app will never
> look, and the thread vanishes from the sidebar. `claude-code-threads` does exactly this evidence
> comparison before every move (see `scheme_evidence` / `choose_scheme`), and refuses to proceed
> if the evidence is genuinely tied.

## Worktree transcript placement

*(observed July 2026, Claude Desktop (Windows); format may change)*

A session started inside a git worktree records the **main repository's** path as `cwd` in its
listing row and transcript entries, but the transcript file itself is written under the
**worktree's own** encoded folder, not the main repo's. Code that resolves "the" transcript
folder for a session from `cwd` alone, without scanning all project folders, will wrongly
report such a session as missing.

## Retention

*(observed July 2026, Claude Desktop (Windows); format may change)*

Transcripts are cleaned up on a retention timer, `cleanupPeriodDays`, defaulting to **30 days**
when unset in `~/.claude/settings.json`. A listing row whose `cliSessionId` no longer resolves
to any transcript on disk is consistent with this: the transcript aged out from under a row
that still references it, which is a normal, expected state rather than corruption.
